             A Profile for Route Path Authorizations (RPAs)
                  draft-guo-sidrops-rpa-profile-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
   content type for Route Path Authorizations (RPA) objects used in
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  An RPA is a digitally
   signed object that provides a means of verifying whether an IP
   address block is received from AS a to AS b and announced from AS b
   to AS c.  When validated, an RPA's eContent can be used for the
   detection and mitigation of route hijacking, especially providing
   protection for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE.

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] was designed with no
   mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes.  There are two
   types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks
   [RFC7908], plague Internet security.

   The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   is to improve route security.  (See [RFC6480] for more information.)
   As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow entities to
   verify that an IP address holder has permitted an AS to advertise a
   route along the propagation path.  A Route Path Authorization (RPA)
   provides this function.

   A RPA is a digitally signed object through which the issuer (the
   holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can authorize one or more
   other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its upstream ASes or one or more
   other ASes as its downstream ASes.  The upstream ASes, or previous
   ASes, mean that the issuer AS can receive BGP route updates from
   these ASes.  The downstream ASes, or next ASes, mean that the issuer
   AS would advertise the BGP route to these ASes.

   This propagation model uses a Web of Trust, i.e., the issuer AS
   trusts its upstream ASes and authorizes its downstream ASes to
   propagate its received routes.  Then, all downstream ASes would also
   accept the routes and proceed to send them to their next hops.  The
   relationship among them is the signed RPA, which attests that a
   downstream AS has been selected by the directly linked upstream AS to
   announce the routes.  This introduces an ingress policy.

   Initially, all ASes on the propagation path should sign one or more
   RPAs independently if they want to propagate the route to its
   downstream ASes, and then be able to detect and filter malicious
   routes (e.g., route leaks and route hijacks).  In addition, the RPA
   can also attest that all ASes on a propagation path have received and
   selected this AS_PATH, which can be certified as a trusted path.

   The RPA uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488]
   for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   wrapper for the RPA content as well as a generic validation procedure
   for RPKI signed objects.  As RPKI certificates issued by the current
   infrastructure are required to validate RPA, we assume the mandatory-
   to-implement algorithms in [RFC6485] or its successor.

   To complete the specification of the RPA (see Section 4 of
   [RFC6488]), this document defines:

   1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the RPA-signed
       object.  This OID appears in the eContentType field of the
       encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed
       attribute within the signerInfo structure.

   2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the RPA content, which is the payload signed
       by the BGP speaker.  The RPA content is encoded using the ASN.1
       [X.680] Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

   3.  The steps required to validate an RPA beyond the validation steps
       specified in [RFC6488].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The RPA Content-Type

   The content-type for an RPA is defined as RoutePathAuthorization and
   has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.(TBD).

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

3.  The RPA eContent

   The content of an RPA identifies feasible AS's route paths.  Upon
   receiving a BGP-UPDATE message, other ASes can perform AS-path
   verification according to the validated RPAs.  An RPA is an instance
   of RoutePathAuthorization, formally defined by the following ASN.1
   [X.680] module:

RPKI-RPA-2025
  { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
     pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-rpki-RPA-2025(TBD) }

    prefixes            SEQUENCE (SIZE(0..MAX)) OF IPAddressFamily OPTIONAL }

ASID ::= INTEGER (0..4294967295)

END

   Note that this content appears as the eContent within the
   encapContentInfo (see [RFC6488]).

3.1.  version

   The version number of the RoutePathAuthorization MUST be 0.

3.2.  asID

   The asID field contains the AS number of the issuer AS associated
   with this RPA.

3.3.  routePaths

   The routePaths field comprises a list of routing intents associated
   with the issuing asID.  Each routing intent generally includes an
   upstream AS, a downstream AS, and a specified route set.  To optimize
   space, the field may aggregate routing paths that share the same
   route set.  Therefore, the routePaths field indicates that for a
   route set represented by origins or prefixes, the issuing asID can
   receive routes from any AS in previousASes and subsequently forward
   them to any AS in nexthopASes.

3.3.1.  previousASes

   The previousASes field contains the upstream ASes' number of the
   issuer AS that can advertise the routes to the issuer AS.

3.3.2.  nexthopASes

   The nexthopASes field contains the downstream ASes' number of the
   issuer AS that can receive advertised routes from the issuer AS.

3.3.3.  origins

   The origins field contains a set of ASes and is associated with Route
   Origin Authorization (ROA) [RFC9582] or Signed Prefix List (SPL)
   [SignedPrefixList].  This is an optional field.  If populated, it
   indicates that all routes belonging to the specified ASes can be
   received from the upstream ASes in the previousASes field and
   advertised to the downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field.  If this
   field is blank, the prefixes field must be checked.  If the prefixes
   field is not empty, it has the meanings defined there.  Otherwise, it
   means that all routes received from the upstream ASes in the
   previousASes field may be advertised to the downstream ASes in the
   nexthopASes field.

3.3.4.  prefixes

   The prefixes field contains optional prefixes.  If populated, it
   indicates that all routes specified can be received from the upstream
   ASes listed in the previousASes field and advertised to the
   downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field.  If this field is blank,
   the origins field MUST be checked.  If the origins field is not
   empty, it has the meanings specified there.  Otherwise, it means that
   all routes received from the upstream ASes in the previousASes field
   may be advertised to the downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field.

4.  RPA Validation

   To validate an RPA, the relying party MUST perform all the validation
   checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following additional
   RPA-specific validation steps.

   *  The contents of the CMS eContent field MUST conform to all the
      constraints described in Section 3.

   *  The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension described in
      [RFC3779] is also used in RPA and MUST be present in the EE
      certificate contained in the CMS certificates field.

   *  The AS identifier present in the RoutePathAuthorization eContent
      'asID' field MUST be contained in the AS Identifiers present in
      the certificate extension.

   *  The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation extension MUST NOT
      contain "inherit" elements.

   *  The IP Address Delegation Extension [RFC3779] is not used in RPA,
      and MUST NOT be present in the EE certificate.

5.  Operational Consideration

   Multiple valid RPA objects which contain the same asID could exist.
   In such a case, the union of these objects forms the complete route
   path set of this AS.  For a given asID, it is RECOMMENDED that a CA
   maintains a single RPA object.  If an AS holder publishes an RPA
   object, then relying parties SHOULD assume that this object is
   complete for that issuer AS.

   If one AS receives a BGP UPDATE message with the issuer AS in the
   AS_PATH attribute which cannot match any routing paths of this issuer
   AS, it implies that there is an AS-path forgery in this message.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC6480], [RFC6481], [RFC6485],
   [RFC6487] and [RFC6488] also apply to RPAs.

7.  IANA Considerations
