--- abstract

This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content type for Route Path Authorizations (RPA) objects used in Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). An RPA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying whether an IP address block is received from `AS a` to `AS b` and announced from `AS b` to `AS c`. When validated, an RPA's eContent can be used for the detection and mitigation of route hijacking, especially providing protection for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE.

# Introduction

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) {{RFC4271}} was designed with no mechanisms to validate the security of BGP attributes. There are two types of BGP security issues, BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks {{RFC7908}}, plague Internet security.

The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is to improve route security.  (See {{RFC6480}} for more information.) As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow entities to verify that an IP address holder has permitted an AS to advertise a route along the propagation path. A Route Path Authorization (RPA) provides this function.

A RPA is a digitally signed object through which the issuer (the holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can authorize one or more other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its upstream ASes or one or more other ASes as its downstream ASes. The upstream ASes, or previous ASes, mean that the issuer AS can receive BGP route updates from these ASes. The downstream ASes, or next ASes, mean that the issuer AS would advertise the BGP route to these ASes.

This propagation model uses a Web of Trust, i.e., the issuer AS trusts its upstream ASes and authorizes its downstream ASes to propagate its received routes. Then, all downstream ASes would also accept the routes and proceed to send them to their next hops. The relationship among them is the signed RPA, which attests that a downstream AS has been selected by the directly linked upstream AS to announce the routes. This introduces an ingress policy.

Initially, all ASes on the propagation path should sign one or more RPAs independently if they want to propagate the route to its downstream ASes, and then be able to detect and filter malicious routes (e.g., route leaks and route hijacks). In addition, the RPA can also attest that all ASes on a propagation path have received and selected this AS_PATH, which can be certified as a trusted path.

The RPA uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects {{RFC6488}} for the definition of a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) {{RFC5652}} wrapper for the RPA content as well as a generic validation procedure for RPKI signed objects.  As RPKI certificates issued by the current infrastructure are required to validate RPA, we assume the mandatory-to-implement algorithms in {{RFC6485}} or its successor.

To complete the specification of the RPA (see {{Section 4 of RFC6488}}), this document defines:

1.  The object identifier (OID) that identifies the FC-signed object. This OID appears in the eContentType field of the encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure.
2.  The ASN.1 syntax for the RPA content, which is the payload signed by the BGP speaker. The RPA content is encoded using the ASN.1 {{X.680}} Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) {{X.690}}.
3.  The steps required to validate an RPA beyond the validation steps specified in {{RFC6488}}.

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# The RPA Content-Type

The content-type for an RPA is defined as ForwardingCommitment and has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.(TBD).

This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute in the signerInfo object (see {{RFC6488}}).

# The RPA eContent {#The-FC-eContent}

The content of an RPA identifies feasible AS's route paths. Upon receiving a BGP-UPDATE message, other ASes can perform AS-path verification according to the validated RPAs. An RPA is an instance of RoutePathAuthorization, formally defined by the following ASN.1 {{X.680}} module:

END
~~~~~~

Note that this content appears as the eContent within the encapContentInfo (see {{RFC6488}}).

## version

The version number of the RoutePathAuthorization MUST be 0.

## asID

The asID field contains the AS number of the issuer AS associated with this RPA.

## routePaths

The routePaths field comprises a list of routing intents associated with the issuing asID. Each routing intent generally includes an upstream AS, a downstream AS, and a specified route set. To optimize space, the field may aggregate routing paths that share the same route set. Therefore, the routePaths field indicates that for a route set represented by origins or prefixes, the issuing asID can receive routes from any AS in previousASes and subsequently forward them to any AS in nexthopASes.

### previousASes

The previousASes field contains the upstream ASes' number of the issuer AS that can advertise the routes to the issuer AS.

### nexthopASes

The nexthopASes field contains the downstream ASes' number of the issuer AS that can receive advertised routes from the issuer AS.

### origins

The origins field contains a set of ASes and is associated with Route Origin Authorization (ROA) {{RFC9582}} or Signed Prefix List (SPL) {{SignedPrefixList}}. This is an optional field. If populated, it indicates that all routes belonging to the specified ASes can be received from the upstream ASes in the previousASes field and advertised to the downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field. If this field is blank, the prefixes field must be checked. If the prefixes field is not empty, it has the meanings defined there. Otherwise, it means that all routes received from the upstream ASes in the previousASes field may be advertised to the downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field.

### prefixes

The prefixes field contains optional prefixes. If populated, it indicates that all routes specified can be received from the upstream ASes listed in the previousASes field and advertised to the downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field. If this field is blank, the origins field MUST be checked. If the origins field is not empty, it has the meanings specified there. Otherwise, it means that all routes received from the upstream ASes in the previousASes field may be advertised to the downstream ASes in the nexthopASes field.


# RPA Validation

To validate an RPA, the relying party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in {{RFC6488}} as well as the following additional RPA-specific validation steps.

- The contents of the CMS eContent field MUST conform to all the constraints described in {{The-RPA-eContent}}.
- The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension described in {{RFC3779}} is also used in RPA and MUST be present in the EE certificate contained in the CMS certificates field.
- The AS identifier present in the RoutePathAuthorization eContent 'asID' field MUST be contained in the AS Identifiers present in the certificate extension.
- The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation extension MUST NOT contain "inherit" elements.
- The IP Address Delegation Extension {{RFC3779}} is not used in RPA, and MUST NOT be present in the EE certificate.

# Operational Consideration

Multiple valid RPA objects which contain the same asID could exist. In such a case, the union of these objects forms the complete route path set of this AS. For a given asID, it is RECOMMENDED that a CA maintains a single RPA object. If an AS holder publishes an RPA object, then relying parties SHOULD assume that this object is complete for that issuer AS.

If one AS receives a BGP UPDATE message with the issuer AS in the AS_PATH attribute which cannot match any routing paths of this issuer AS, it implies that there is an AS-path forgery in this message.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of {{RFC6480}}, {{RFC6481}}, {{RFC6485}}, {{RFC6487}} and {{RFC6488}} also apply to RPAs.
